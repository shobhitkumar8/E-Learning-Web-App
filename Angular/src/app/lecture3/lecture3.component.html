<p><b>What is TypeScript?</b></p>
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.<br>
There are three main primitives in JavaScript and TypeScript.

boolean - true or false values
number - whole numbers and floating point values
string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks".

<p><b>Why should I use TypeScript?</b></p>
<p> JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not</p>

<p><b>How do I use TypeScript?</b></p>
A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!
